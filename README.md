Design stages:
  Documentation of the different stages of your design (see above, with additional material, e.g. sketches, mockups, questionnaires, etc.)
  - design mockup
  - use case diagram
  - class diagrams (MainActivity, ReceiptItemAdapter, Product, SplitReceiptFragment, SplitPricesFragment)


Design Decisions:
  A summary of your design decisions and what they were based on.

Testing:
  (Not required, but seen as a plus:) Evaluation/Testing results (qualitative, quantitative). There should be a description on when and how testing took place, and a presentation of the results.


Implementation difficulties:
  - Scanning issues

  - Asynchronous loading of fragment

  - Bug with checkboxes
