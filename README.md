## About:
This is an Android application that was developed for a mobile app development course at UCSB. We were given the opportunity to develop any Android application that we'd like, so we decided to tackle an issue that all of us had previously faced: manually splitting up the costs of going grocery shopping with your roommates or housemates. Our app makes this simple:
1. Enter names of participating individuals
2. Take a photo of the receipt
3. Our application will scan and parse the receipt and return a list of all purchased items
4. Each item will have a checkbox for each participating individual. Simply check the box for each person who bought a specific item (you can also select more than one person if multiple people are splitting one item.)
5. Simply hit "Done" at the bottom of the page and our application will quickly split up the cost and output how much each person owes.

Note: Given time constraints, this application only works on processing Costco receipts.
